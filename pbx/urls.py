"""pbx URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))

# This overrides names in site headers and titles
# , not required if custom admin templates are being used
# but no harm in setting them.

admin.site.site_title = _('DjangoPBX Admin Portal')
admin.site.index_title = _('Welcome to the DjangoPBX Admin Portal')

# Routers provide an easy way of automatically determining the URL conf.
# These are mostly used for the REST API
# Some Routers may appear commented out, these are add-on applications
# that provide API endpoints and can be installed from the djangopbx-applications repository.
# Once you have installed the application (copied the files),
# simply un-comment the application if it appears commented out below.
# You will also find a corresponding entry in the router.registry
# section below, please also uncomment that entry.
